## Jubai Han 
Hello there! My name's Jubai, a ginger cat about to turn three. My first year was filled with trials; I was parted from my mother and faced the wrath of other cats. But just when things looked bleak, my very own Superman swooped in, rescuing me and bringing me to a place I now call home. In my current daily life, I relish the flavors of prawns and steak, but what is the true highlight of my day? I'm eagerly waiting for my mom's return so we can indulge in our favorite game of catch. My heart's deepest desire? To have my mom beside me every single day!

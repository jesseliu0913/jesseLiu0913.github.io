## Jubai Han 
Meow meow~ Hello everyone! I’m Jubai, a ginger kitty about to turn three years old 🎂🐱.
My very first year was full of ups and downs: I was separated from my mama and even bullied by other cats. My world felt so gloomy… until my very own Superman appeared! He swooped in, rescued me, and gave me a warm and loving home. 💕

These days, life is purr-fect! I love feasting on juicy prawns and sizzling steak—my little tummy always ends up nice and round. But you know what the real highlight of my day is? Waiting for my mom to come home! The moment she walks through the door, I dash over so we can play our favorite game of catch together. 🐾🎉

And my deepest wish? To have my mom by my side every single day, so I can always be her sweet, cuddly little kitty. ✨💖
